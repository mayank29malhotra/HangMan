# HangMan
This a Python code for the simple HangMan Game made by me without GUI. This game is inspired by Original HANG-MAN GAME. The Word List used was taken from the internet also the different stages (ascii art) shown in the game of the life was also taken from google

This Game is made as a practice so that i could test my basic python skills as i am learning this language.
